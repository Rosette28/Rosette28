# Hi there 👋, I'm Rosette

🎓 **CS student at the University of Haifa (Etgar program), Final Year!**

🚀 Started my B.Sc. at 14, graduating at 17

💡 **Passionate about:**  
- Algorithms & computational models  
- Machine learning & deep learning
- Algorithmic Game Theory
- Writing elegant, efficient solutions in **Python** & **C / C++** (especially python)

🔭 **Currently exploring:**  
- Algorithmic Game Theory
- Deep Learning
- DevOps (currently learning a devOps course)

📂 **Check out my projects:**  
- Rock-Paper-Scissors-Simulator [(link)](https://github.com/Rosette28/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Simulator) – A Python project to simulate and analyze different strategies in the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game. The project implements a variety of strategies, including probabilistic, reactive, and adaptive behaviors, and allows comparisons between them through simulation. The project will be occasionally updated - I have many ideas for things to add
- iot-biometric-safe [(link)](https://github.com/Rosette28/iot-biometric-safe) – This project implements a secure safe opening system using ESP32 and the Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor. It leverages multi-factor authentication for enhanced security and integrates real-time monitoring through ThingSpeak (cloud-based dashboard). this was the final project at school (did it when I was 15-16) and it focused mostly on hardware
- hangman-game-python [(link)](https://github.com/Rosette28/hangman-game-python) - This is a classic Hangman game built with Python. The game allows a user to guess a secret word one letter at a time. The user is given six attempts to guess the word before the game ends. The game is interactive and runs in the terminal with colorful ASCII art for the hangman as incorrect guesses accumulate. I created this game when I was 13 years old as the final project for a Python programming course. It represents my early steps into programming (my first project).

✨ Always learning, building, and aiming for creative solutions.
